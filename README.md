# checklist
A checklist for organizing Rust KW meetups

## 3 weeks before

- [ ] Communicate with the speakers and get a talk description
- [ ] Make sure the talk description is actually engaging or no one will want to come to the event
- [ ] Feel free to ask for more details from the speaker about their description and even edit it yourself if you need to


## 2 weeks before

- [ ] Post the meetup
- [ ] Create a meetup event by copying one of the older ones and updating the information
- [ ] Make sure to cover:
   - [ ] Rough schedule
   - [ ] Location
   - [ ] Parking
   - [ ] Food (whether it is provided or not)
- [ ] Setup the meetup event to ask people about their dietary restrictions when they register
- [ ] Make a (rough) plan for who will tweet about what and when they will send their tweets
- [ ] Make sure to tag both `@rustlang` and `#rustlang` in your tweets
- [ ] If your tweet does not get retweeted by `@rustlang`, politely DM them with a link (they are hit with a firehose of tweets and things get missed)
- [ ] May also want to tag specific Rust community twitter accounts (e.g. `@Rust_gamedev`) or hash tags (e.g. `#gamedev`)
- [ ] Add the event to the Rust community calendar so it shows up in This Week in Rust
- [ ] May want to consider posting on the Rust subreddit as well, though this is not appropriate always
- [ ] If your event needs Wi-Fi (e.g. a workshop), make sure your venue has it or you can arrange for it

## 1 week before

- [ ] Figure out who will order the food and when, take the dietary restrictions into account and keep in mind that people may register up to the day of the event
- [ ] It's always a good idea to get a spread of options even if dietary restrictions aren't explicitly listed

## 1 day before

- [ ] Send reminder on Meetup
- [ ] Tweet about it

## Day of meetup

- [ ] Name tags
- [ ] Markers for writing names
- [ ] Video camera (if applicable)
- [ ] Sound recording equipment (if applicable)
- [ ] Order food
- [ ] Set up doorbell (if applicable)
- [ ] Tweet about it
- [ ] Set up chromecast (if applicable)
- [ ] Get WiFi info (if applicable)
- [ ] Have the organizers & speakers arrive early so you can setup, deal with AV, greet people, etc.
- [ ] Decide on one "MC" for the event who will introduce speakers and help transition between talks and each stage of the event
- [ ] At the start of the event, have the MC cover the following:
    - [ ] Introduce themselves and introduce the organizers (have each organizer raise their hand so the audience sees who they are)
    - [ ] Thank the audience for coming to the meetup (especially if the weather is bad/other things are happening that may have made showing up hard)
   - [ ] Event logistics:
   - [ ] Schedule of today's event (always need to cover this even if there is just one thing)
   - [ ] Point out the nametag table
   - [ ] Food
   - [ ] Washrooms
   - [ ] Upcoming events
   - [ ] Thank any sponsors
   - [ ] Once all of this is covered: introduce the first speaker and bring them up to setup their slides and start talking
- [ ] Between each speaker and at the end, have the MC come up to transition to the next thing
- [ ] Always have the MC ask the audience to give the speaker a hand (they should be acknowledged for their talk!)

## After the meetup

- [ ] Retrospective with the organizers:
    - [ ] What went well?
    - [ ] What could have been better?
    - [ ] How will we improve for next time?
    - [ ] What adjustments/additions/deletions need to be made to these checklists?
    - [ ] Comments about logistics: food budget, venue, etc.
- [ ] Get links to the speaker's slides and post them as comments on the meetup event
- [ ] Email thanks to the speakers and let them know that they are welcome to speak again at a future event
- [ ] If you need speakers for a future event, the best time to email about that is just after a meetup while people are still remember being happy about attending the event
